## What is the growth mindset? Why do you need it?


The growth mindset refers to the underlying belief that people have about learning and intelligence. People that have a growth mindset embrace challenges and persists in them. So, their talents can be developed and molded into something great. However, there is a mindset called the fixed mindset and it is the opposite of the growth mindset. Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that talent and intelligence are fixed. If you have a growth mindset, you embrace mistakes as a part of the learning process.

Taking on the growth mindset fully can be a difficult task if you have a fixed mindset. However, having a growth mindset will change your life because it means that you can grow and change as an individual. Also if you take on the growth mindset you can reduce burnout and know that you are the best you can be.

### How to develop a growth mindset?

1. Realize that it is possible to change.
2. Every time you have a "fixed mindset" voice in your head correct it.
  - You can say things like "When I struggle with something it means that I'm learning." or "I need to keep working at it".
3. Give yourself rewards
4. Ask someone that is knowledgeable on the topic how you did.
5. Stay out of your comfort zone.
6. Realize that failure is a part of the progress.


### How I will be keeping myself in a growth mindset? :thought_balloon:
1. Writing goals to keep myself accountable.
2. Include “yet” in my vocabulary to remind myself that I can overcome anything with time and effort.
3. Appreciate the journey and celebrate every small win.

In the words of Theodore Roosevelt
> It is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.
