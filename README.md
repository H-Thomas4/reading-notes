The growth mindset refers to the underlying belief that people have about learning and intelligence. People that have a growth mindset embrace challenges and persists in them. So, their talents can be developed and molded into something great. However, there is a mindset called the fixed mindset and it is the opposite of the growth mindset. Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that talent and intelligence are fixed. If you have a growth mindset, you embrace mistakes as a part of the learning process.

**More Characteristics of a Growth Mindset**
- Embrace life long learning
- Have the belief that errors lead to mastery
- Believe that errors are temporary setsbacks
- Embrace as many challenges as you can

**More Characteristics of a Fixed Mindset**
- Avoiding challenge to avoid failure
- Hiding flaws in order to not be judged by others.
- Giving up easily

Taking on the growth mindset fully can be a difficult task if you have a fixed mindset. However, having a growth mindset will change your life because it means that you can grow and change as an individual. Also if you take on the growth mindset you can reduce burnout and know that you are the best you can be.

### How to develop a growth mindset?

1. Realize that it is possible to change.
2. Every time you have a "fixed mindset" voice in your head correct it.
  - You can say things like "When I struggle with something it means that I'm learning." or "I need to keep working at it".
3. Give yourself rewards
4. Ask someone that is knowledgeable on the topic how you did.
5. Stay out of your comfort zone.
6. Realize that failure is a part of the progress.


In the words of Theodore Roosevelt
> It is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.
